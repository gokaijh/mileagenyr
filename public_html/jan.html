Before I joined Mileage in October 2008, I was a recreational runner, although I had been completing about one marathon a year between 2003 to 2007.  I was running because I enjoy running and it helped me to fit into my clothes given my ever-increasing voracious appetite.  I ran my marathons without much of a target or goal, as I did not know how to improve.  I thought that I can only run faster if I run a lot more (some marathon programmes suggest running/training like 6 times a week!), which I was unable to do given my work and church ministry commitments.
<br><br>When I heard about Mileage's 14-week training programme for the StanChart Marathon 2008, I was really excited about it at the prospect of improving my marathon timing with just 3 training sessions per week.  I signed up for it immediately, although at the back of my mind, I was a little skeptical if just 3 training sessions per week were sufficient to help me to make any significant improvement.  I remembered asking Coach a few times at the start of the programme: "Just 3 times a week, really enough ah?"
<br><br>During the programme, I enjoyed every of the training sessions, which was well-balanced and safe, although at times tough and at times very, very tough.  Well-balanced as the trainings involved a combination of conditioning, speed and endurance.  Safe as in Coach will monitor our progress weekly and step up our trainings accordingly.  (As a result of this "safe" element, I did not fall sick during the entire training period as well as after the marathon.  When I was training on my own, my trainings were often disrupted as I would fall sick from over-exertion by increasing mileage randomly and recklessly at times when I needed to play catch-up.)  
<br><br>Besides the training sessions, I also appreciated Coach's support to the group of runners and the camaraderie and encouragement among the group.  (The great friends I made from Mileage are a wonderful bonus!)  To this day, I still remember with much fondness and gratitude of Coach's dedication to us when he became a mobile water-station for all of us on his motor-bike, giving us drinks support throughout our training runs along the actual route.        
<br><br>At the end of the programme, Coach and I agreed on a goal of 4 hrs 30 mins (as I did 4 hrs 44 mins for StanChart 2007).  I eventually completed StanChart 2008 marathon in 4 hrs 20 mins (a 24-min improvement from 2007), which was a very pleasant surprise for myself and Coach.  I know that this could not have happened if not for Mileage and Coach.  I would never have been able to do this on my own.
<br><br>Many of my friends were surprised at the improvement I made in that marathon.  And I just love to see their look of envy and surprise when I tell them that I only had to run 3 times a week to achieve that! :)
<br><br>After StanChart 2008, I carried on with Mileage in 2009 and achieved 3 more PBs for 10 km (I won the 8th prizes under the Veteran Category in the 10 km Newton Active Run - 51 mins), 21 km (I won 5th prize in the Bidor Half Marathon - 1 hr 53 mins) and 42 km (I achieved my sub-4 hr dream in the recent Gold Coast Marathon - 3 hrs 56 mins) races. 
<br><br>Boston Marathon Dream - does not seem too impossible now, even for one who just runs 3 times a week!  :)
