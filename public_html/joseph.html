Over the years, I continued to run and occasionally took part in 10Km and half-marathon. But always ended up in pain after the run.  Still, the thought of full marathon from time to time, keeps coming back, reminding me of an unfinished challenge. I began to read books on marathon and tried to follow their examples but it was not easy. Soon I was back to 4.3km weekend run at Bedok Reservoir.

<br><br>In Jan 2014, through my friend, Randy, I joined a group of runners from Mileage, under the watchful eyes of our coach, Kien Mau. I thoroughly enjoy the training and my new found friends, they were very encouraging and are fun to run with. Our coach is a minimalist, he keeps drills simple yet very intense during the training sessions. These involve doing STRENGTH on Monday, SPEED on Wed and ENDURANCE RUN on Sat, resting us on other days to recover. In addition, our coach provides each of us an account on his website to track and assess our progress and advice us individually. This is important, because the feedback would helps each of us identify our strength and weakness, and what you ought to do.

<br><br>2011, I completed the SAFRA(10Km) with a timing of 1hr 8mins. In 2014 March, I ran 2XU(10Km) with a timing of 00:50:37, then in May, Sundown(10Km), my timing was 00:050:48 and in early June, I ran Pocari Sweat(10Km) and finished in 00:49:50, my PB so far. I am 54 years old and with only six months of training, it is hard to believe! These achievements clearly shows the training programs under Coach, Kien Mau, really works and produce amazing results. I am enjoying my running and appreciate the importance of proper training and self-discipline in order to achieve the desire outcome.

<br><br>I am looking forward to run half-marathon races and do better than what I did for 2013 Sundown Half-Marathon, finishing with a timing of 3hrs 12mins. Coach, told me if I break my 50mins for 10Km, then next is 21.1Km. I hope I made it!!!

<br><br>Looking forward to my next phases of training sessions.

<br><br>Thank you very much! Coach.
